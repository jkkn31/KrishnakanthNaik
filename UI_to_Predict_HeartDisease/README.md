## Heart Disease Prediction App

https://heartdiseasejkkn.streamlit.app/

This Application will be helpful to check the chances of diagnose with Heart Disease using few personal key indicators.

I developed this application using Machine Learning by training 3Lakhs records of data.

* Random Forest is the best model so far compare to other models and the Random Forest model AUC score is ~85%.
* Morever RandomForest model performance is pretty stable compare to Logistic model on every dataset like (Train, Test and Validation).
